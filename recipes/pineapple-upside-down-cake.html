    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a 13x9-inch pan, melt butter in oven.
            Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over butter.
            Open can of pineapple slices and drain juice into separate cup for a later step. Arrange pineapple slices on brown sugar. 
            Place cherry in center of each pineapple slice, and arrange remaining cherries around slices; press gently into brown sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Using the reserved pineapple juice, add just enough water to make 1 cup. 
            Put the cake mix into a bowl, adding the pudding mix, eggs, oil, and pineapple juice.
            Blend with hand mixer and pour finished batter over pineapples and cherries.
        </li>
        <li>Bake 42 to 48 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. 
            Immediately run a butter knife around side of pan to loosen cake. 
            Place heatproof serving plate upside down onto pan; turn plate and pan over. 
            Leave pan over the cake for 5 minutes so brown sugar can drizzle over the cake; remove pan. 
            Cool 30 minutes. Serve warm or cool. Store covered in refrigerator.
